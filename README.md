# Sample Godot 4 Input Handlers for Node2D

This sample demonstrates how you could set up input handling for static bodies to support Drag & Drop.

It is strongly related to [my other sample on Drag & Drop between `Control` and `Node2D` nodes](https://github.com/jeroenheijmans/sample-godot-drag-drop-from-control-to-node2d).
However, **this sample focuses on setting the `InputEvent` as "handled"** instead.

## Notes

Be warned!
This repository:

- Was created while _learning_ Godot 4, and is _not_ "expert advice";
- Will likely not be kept up to date;
- Might have differences for Godot 3.x and earlier;

Still, it might help someone!

## Demo

This is what it should do:
